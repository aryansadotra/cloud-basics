          Final Assignment: Hand-on-Labs: Architect a cloud base solution 

Why would you choose Cloud computing over traditional hosting on a local server? 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cloud computing offers businesses more flexibility and scalability than hosting on a local server. 

It is a business model or service that combines technology like virtualization with a few of the latest trends and if you require extra bandwidth, a Cloud-based service can address that need promptly, rather than waiting for a complex and costly update to your IT infrastructure.

Users can customize their applications using Cloud services from anywhere if they have an Internet connection.

In addition, Cloud computing enables efficient marketing of applications regardless of maintenance and cost. 

To get a common understanding of Cloud computing, let's start with the US National Institute of Standards and Technology, (NIST)'s definition of Cloud computing.

NIST defines Cloud computing as a model for enabling convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction. 

Examples of computing resources include networks, servers, storage, applications, and services. This Cloud model is composed of five essential characteristics, four deployment models and three service models. 

Let's start with understanding the five essential characteristics of the Cloud, which include on-demand self service, broad network access, resource pooling, rapid elasticity, and measured service. 

On demand self-service, the first characteristic, means you can access Cloud resources whenever required. For example, a 24-hour ATM or a vending machine at the office or store. Services are always available on all days of the year, regardless of whether a particular day is a national holiday, weekend, festival day, and so on. 

There are no exceptions other than when services are unable due to an outage or security breach. Broad network access means that Cloud computing resources can be accessed through the network.

Public Cloud services could generally be accessible from anywhere and on any device with Internet connectivity and browser capabilities. Today, we are open to more than just desktops or laptops when accessing Cloud services. 

There are many other devices such as tablets, iPads, smartphones, e-readers, smart wearables, and so on. Also, to emphasize again, Internet access is mandatory for accessing public Cloud services. However, in an on-premises private Cloud, an Intranet can only suffice for accessing Cloud services, provided the organization does not need to reach out to the entire world public.

With resource pooling, consumers save on costs when using a shared model. This model provides Cloud providers economies of scale, which they can pass on to their customers. Making the Cloud cost efficient. Computing resources are pulled to serve multiple consumers using a multi-tenant model, Cloud resources are dynamically assigned and reassigned according to demand without customers needing to concern themselves with the physical location of these resources.

Rapid elasticity implies that you can increase or decrease resources as per your demand. Because of the elastic property of the Cloud, resources can be scaled up or down vertically scaling or scaled out as in horizontal scaling. An ideal example would be to add resources when there is an increase in demand due to the increase in the number of users while shopping online, like during a holiday sale and the converse after the sales period.

Measured service means that you only pay for what you use or reserve as you go. Measured services, however, do not apply to certain Cloud services, such as general email services like ""Gmail, Hotmail, Yahoo, social media sites like Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp "" and Cloud service evaluation on a trial basis like "" AWS, Azure and GCP "" which are provided for free due to the discretion policies extended by the respective service providers. 

Measured service is also termed as a utility model of billing, where you are charged after the usage and at the end of the predefined period, like monthly electric charges. We will discuss the deployment and service models later in this module.

Welcome to Overview of Cloud Computing: Definition and Essential Characteristics - Expert Viewpoints.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We will listen to several cloud native and application development professionals discuss the definition of cloud computing and cloud computing's unique attributes.

How do you define cloud computing and what are some of its attributes?

>> As a cloud native developer, cloud computing basically boils down to two things for me.

>> First, it is on demand and second, it is self-serving. So what that means is as a developer, I should be able to log into a portal and get the exact amount of services that I need. I'm not waiting around for procurement or infrastructure services to assign something or provision something for me. And this is true for the whole stack, ranging from infrastructure to platform to solution as a service.

>> To me, cloud computing is the ability to deploy code or infrastructure anywhere in the world and at scale. Some of the key characteristics include distribution, high availability, resiliency and scalability.
>> Cloud computing refers to the delivery of computing services that can include servers, database, networking, analytics, etc, over Internet or cloud. Key attributes of cloud computing are flexible cost, global scale, reduced time to deploy resources, higher productivity and performance, and higher reliability and security. >> To me, cloud computing means unlimited compute, database, machine learning capacity and the ability to work with that in an instant. Unlike with data centers where you need to order all those things, set it up and manage the availability of it yourself, with cloud computing, the cloud provider manages the physical security of the service for you and all you do is manage the stuff on it. >> I would summarize cloud computing as a suite of API driven services to manage all aspects of compute networking resources for enterprise computing. You could think of it as virtualized resources defined by software. Some other key characteristics are the resources are elastic and can grow or shrink with demand, think of e-commerce on high demand holidays. Also, the computing costs are dynamic, so instead of capital expenditures for hardware, you have operating expenses for cloud resources. >> To me, cloud computing is not a yes or no, it's really a scale. And everything uses cloud computing, or almost everything does nowadays. The idea is that you can dip your toes in, just use cloud computing for a little bit like authentication, use some social login so people can log in with their Facebook or their Google login, or you can go all the way in and have your entire project hosted on a cloud based infrastructure. The point is that both of those leverage cloud technologies really whenever you reach into that [LAUGH] void of the cloud and take compute power or something else, storage, it doesn't matter that is using a cloud technology. And I think that's really important to understand, almost everything is the cloud nowadays. >> There's a joke that cloud computing is just using someone else's computer over the Internet, that's only very narrowly true. What cloud computing actually gives you is a degree of availability, consistency, and scalability that you very likely would not be able to achieve running your own machines. At its best, cloud computing allows you to abstract away the management of the things you probably don't care about and focus on the things that you do care about. >> With high performance compute in the cloud, you can have extremely fast clusters of computers at your fingertips and only pay for them when you need them. And thanks to the cloud, smaller companies are able to set up high performance compute clusters and innovate rapidly.
